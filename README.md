ðŸ”§ What I Did:
Created a sales database in MySQL and populated it with realistic, mock transactional data

Wrote SQL queries to analyze:

Total sales by region

Top-performing products

Monthly sales trends

Developed an interactive dashboard in JavaScript using Chart.js (not included in GitHub due to browser-based nature), which visualizes:

Regional sales performance

Monthly comparisons

Built a professional Excel report, including:

Pivot tables for data summarization

A visual bar chart representing sales trends

This project helped solidify my skills in data modeling, SQL analytics, frontend data visualization, and Excel reporting â€” all crucial tools in a Data Analyst's toolbox.
